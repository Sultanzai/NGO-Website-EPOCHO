                                        <p>EPOCHO came into existence as a response to the lagging society and weak governance in terms of public services founded largely
                                            by a group of demobilized, free, educated and expert Afghans. Throughout these years, EPOCHO focused primarily on
                                            gathering expert and educated Afghans around the globe, building an accountable and efficient framework able to work
                                            with national and international institutions, designing and implementing of EPOCHO’s fully funded self-projects.
